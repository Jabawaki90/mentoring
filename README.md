# Mentoring

Welcome to this repository that is meant to test your skills in git.

# Goal of this repository

1. To ensure you have the minimal technical knowledge to join the program

## Prerequisite in knowledge & skills
1. Ability in Git using the CLI
2. Paying attention to details
3. Willing to ask if things aren't clear

## To Do:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a folder at `/applications/<nickname` with your nickname as the folder name
3. Within the folder, ensure the following files & details are present
	- resume in pdf format (please include all the details of your experience)
	- cover letter in pdf format (please mention why you are interested in joining this program)
4. Create a PR to this repository on your changes
	- Ensure that the reviewer is me so that I can get notified
	- Title of the PR is: <nickname> application
	- Ensure that your git commit follows [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
	- Ensure that your git commit is small & often.
	- Ensure that your 1 commit is 1 thing.
	- Ensure that your commit message is clear. (eg: "Update application" & "update resume" is not acceptable. Elaborate further: "add latest job in resume" is clearer & much better)

#### Notes:
- nickname: Name that you want people to call you
- resume & cover letter: Do remember this is not for a job. So, don't worry too much and just share. Please do not include your house address or sensitive information like that


# Note
The purpose of this is to provide an opportunity for you to get real world experience in web development. Its about learning. Basically, leave your ego at the door. We are all here to learn, irregardless of your seniority / experience. That include myself.

I might have more experience but that doesn't mean that I know everything. So, don't put yourself down thinking you aren't good enough. However, please keep in mind the following:

**Everything that is done must have a reason. Even if the reason could be: I don't know any other better solutions that time. So, always seek to understand rather than judge**

If you are shy to ask, you will be stupid forever.

# Good luck
